# Case Studies - careflow-mcp

Real-world implementation examples demonstrating how to use the careflow-mcp server with Claude AI to automate complex workflows.

## Overview

These case studies show practical applications of the MCP server across different industries. Each includes:
- **Use case description** and business problem
- **Claude conversation examples** showing natural language interaction
- **Benefits and ROI** metrics
- **n8n workflow configuration** (importable JSON in `/examples`)
- **Step-by-step setup** instructions

## Case Studies

### 🏥 1. Healthcare Patient Management
**File**: [01-healthcare-patient-management.md](./01-healthcare-patient-management.md)
**Example Workflow**: [(https://github.com/pratapsfdc22-dev/Careflow-MCP/blob/main/healthcare-patient-task-workflow.json)]

### 🛒 2. E-commerce Order Processing
**File**: [02-ecommerce-order-processing.md](./02-ecommerce-order-processing.md)
**Example Workflow**:[(https://github.com/pratapsfdc22-dev/Careflow-MCP/blob/main/ecommerce-order-workflow.json)]
Process orders, manage inventory, and handle customer notifications through conversational AI.

**Key Benefits**:
- 90% faster order processing
- Automated inventory updates
- Real-time customer notifications
- Fraud detection integration

## Quick Start

### 1. Import Workflow to n8n

```bash
# Navigate to n8n
# Go to: Workflows > Import from File
# Select a workflow JSON from /examples folder
```

### 2. Configure Credentials

Each workflow requires:
- n8n API credentials
- Service-specific credentials (Slack, email, database, etc.)

### 3. Activate Workflow

Enable the workflow in n8n and note its webhook URL.

### 4. Use with Claude

Ask Claude to trigger workflows:

```
"Create a high-priority patient task for ID P12345 in the Patient Care workflow"
```
